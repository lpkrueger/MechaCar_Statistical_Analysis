# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Module 16, R and Statistics - UNCCH Data Analytics Bootcamp, Spring 2023

## Project Overview

### Purpose
In this exercise, I am helping Jeremy and the data analytics team with AutosRUs to garner insidghts from production data to help the manufacturing team relieve production troubles and restore progress on the MechaCar project. 


## Method
We will be using R to perform retrospective analysis of historical data to create summary statistics, determine predictive variables, and understand performance differences with other manufacturers. The source data was retrieved from .CSV files. 

From the Module 16 Challenge: 
```
    Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

    Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.

    Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.

    Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Statistical metrics from the multiple linear regression model were produced using the following code sample: 
```
    lm(mpg ~ vehicle_length + vehicle_weight + spoiler_angle + ground_clearance + AWD,data=mpg_table)
```
Output from Linear Regression

According to the results, vehicle length and ground clearance (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random variance to the linear model, due to their very small P-values. In other words, vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on mpg. 

The p-value "Pr(>|t|)" of the linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and assume the slope of the linear model is NOT zero.

The Multiple R-squared value of the linear model is .715, which means that the model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes with just over 70% accuracy. To get a more acurate model it may be necesssary to determine other more significant factors that contribute to mpg. 


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The technical anaysis of suspension coils for production MechaCar parts were produced using the following code sample: 
```
    total_summary <- coil_table %>% summarize(Mean=mean(PSI), Median=median(PSI), Variance=var(PSI), SD = sd(PSI))

    lot_summary <- coil_table %>% group_by(Manufacturing_Lot) %>% summarize(Mean_PSI=mean(PSI), Median=median(PSI), Variance=var(PSI), SD = sd(PSI), .groups = 'keep')
```
Output from Total Summary

Output from Lot Summary
    ![lot_summary](/lot_summary.png)

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the must not exceed 100 psi. This analysis of the manufacturing data shows that the total variance is 62 psi. However, when grouped by manufacturing lot, the variance of lot 3 is 170 psi, which means that lot 3 should be quarantined and examined for individual part compliance. 


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

T-Tests of the suspension coil data were performed to determine if the PSI for each manufacturing lot is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 psi using the following code sample: 
```
    t.test(coil_table$PSI,mu=1500)
    t.test(subset(coil_table, Manufacturing_Lot == "Lot1")$PSI,mu=1500)
    t.test(subset(coil_table, Manufacturing_Lot == "Lot2")$PSI,mu=1500)
    t.test(subset(coil_table, Manufacturing_Lot == "Lot3")$PSI,mu=1500)
```
Output from T-Tests
    ![t_tests](/t_tests.png)

The p-value for the total coil spring samples is .06, which is higher than our significance level of .05, so we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis - this means that the sample mean is statistically similar to the supplied population mean. This is also true for lots 1 and 2 as well. 
However, lot 3's p-value is .04, which is less than our significance level of .05, meaning the null can be rejected and the sample is not regarded as statistically similar to the population mean - another indication that lot 3 needs to be quarantined and inspected for compliance, if not rejected completely. 


## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Using your knowledge of R, design a statistical study to compare performance of the MechaCar vehicles against performance of vehicles from other manufacturers.

Follow the instructions below to complete Part 4.

    In your README, create a subheading ## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition.

    Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

    In your description, address the following questions:

        What metric or metrics are you going to test?

        What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

        What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

        What data is needed to run the statistical test?
